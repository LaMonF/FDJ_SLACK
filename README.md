#### Balance Management
The balance calculation is based on the official documentation (2018) provided by FDJ. 

You **MUST** define a balance management **file path** in the `settings.yml`. 
This file will be loaded by the application then updated by the results of the draws.
It handles `float64` with 2 numbers after coma. (eg: 66.66)


#### Scheduled events
- Every MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, SATURDAY at 22h the balance is adjusted based on the last draw results.
